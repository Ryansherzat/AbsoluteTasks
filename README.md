# AbsoluteTasks
# Note: 
# About the fourth task of Task #2(Rest Assured) , you give distance value return as "1299816" on paper , but actual value is "1299823". 
  So I put actual value  in my assertion body in order to pass the test. Just let you know. 
  If the aim of task is failing the assertion , we can change ".equalTo(1299823))" to ".equalTo(1299816))".
